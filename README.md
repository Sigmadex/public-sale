# Fair Launch & Community Sale (Price Discovery Event)

## Summary
<em>Sigmadex is proposing a community driven token sale event for accurate price discovery. This concept utilizes Sigma Curves for price determination, liquidity and vesting while giving an opportunity for the public to obtain the same valuation tiers as all earlier investors. This is all accomplished through game theory economics.</em>

## Motivation

Many projects use the same mundane public sale models which involve arbitrary parameters resulting in erroneous price discovery and economic imbalance.

|Outcome|Interpretation|
|-------|--------------|
|The auction doesn't sell out | Price is overvalued |
|**The auction successfully sells out** | Price is accurate or undervalued |

By using a Sigma Curve, we add the most liquidity at the highest price, making it intentionally harder to fill the public auction. This ensures the price discovery is accurate relative to demand as we already know there will be demand at the earlier rounds. If the end price is set too high it will struggle to reach its target and be apparent that the pricing parameters are out of balance. 

Choosing the proper initial variables should be systematic and is critical - as being greedy and setting a high end value will not setup the protocol for growth.
